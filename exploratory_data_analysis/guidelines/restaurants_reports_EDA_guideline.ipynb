    "Apptopia and Foursquare dataset have valuable information across 16 weeks measuring the level of app usage and visits (dining, pick-up food) in restaurants across the country (unfortunately, it's a nationwide analysis), coffee shops, and fast-food chains, to compare trends between different categories of food and to know which businesses really need to invest in more technology.\n",

    "- Group the restaurants by county evaluating their situation: %using delivery, %using pick_up, % temporarily closed, % cash-only, and categories of food).\n",
    "- Display mobility information by county.\n",
    "- Generate a report of the state evaluating the situation of every county or the most interesting counties. For instance: California, County X: Scenario: people are likely to move X distance from their residence. They are walking more than they drive and parks are more empty: --> restaurants near to parks need to build partnerships with delivery services (show %not doing that yet). (If the state preferences are contactless payments, suggest that cash-only businesses need to change their payment methods and so on).\n",
    "- **Follow-up** clusters of counties. Identify similarities in the situation of counties in the same state. How? Unsupervised Machine Learning. If the county is a vector of features and the features are mobility trends and restaurant information, we can build clusters of similar counties, it means, counties in similar conditions, and generate a report of the state grouping counties."

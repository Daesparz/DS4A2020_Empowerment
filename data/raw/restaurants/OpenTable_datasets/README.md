# About the data

The data indexes two things.

First, the overall impact of Covid 19 on the industry by showing year-over-year seated diners at a sample of restaurants on the OpenTable network across all channels: online reservations, phone reservations, and walk-ins. For year-over-year comparisons by day, we compare to the same day of the week from the same week in the previous year. For example, weâ€™d compare Tuesday of week 11 in 2020 to Tuesday of week 11 in 2019. Only states or metros with 50+ restaurants on the OpenTable network for 2019 or 2020 are included in the sample. To better reflect the state of the industry overall, this dataset is based on a sample of approximately 20,000 restaurants that provide OpenTable with information on all of their inventory. This sample of restaurants typically accounts for a majority of our seated online reservations.

Second, a comparison of year-over-year seated covers to demonstrate where we are seeing recovery start to take shape. This table shows year-over-year seated covers across all channels at only the restaurants that have chosen to reopen in a given market. As an example, if there were 50 seated covers in restaurants that have recently reopened in a given locale on May 11, 2019 and on the same day in 2020 there was 1, then 2% will be displayed. For this chart, only markets with 500+ restaurants on OpenTable of which 10%+ are accepting online reservations are included.

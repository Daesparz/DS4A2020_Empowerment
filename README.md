# How to help the restaurant industry survive?

## Project Scoping
### Overview of industry, business, or problem

During 2020, Congress passed a $25 billion COVID-19 bailout for the airline industry but not one tailored to the restaurant industry, which is four times bigger in terms of sales and 18 times bigger in number of jobs (restaurant industry is the nation’s second-largest private-sector employer with an employee base of 15.6 million). Restaurant industry losses are on track to top $240 billion by the end of 2020 — more than any other industry. 
Define the specific problem that should be solved

### How to help the restaurant industry survive?

- Identify who needs a delivery partner, switch to curbside pick-up or keep their strategies.

#### How to answer those questions:

- Analysis of consumer preferences (availability to coming back to restaurants or not, likely to buy food through delivery services, curbside pick-up or in-store, likely to use a mobile app to buy food, contactless payment methods or cash instead). 
- Analysis of foot traffic and mobility patterns: detecting businesses in areas with less foot traffic, businesses far away from recreational areas, transit stations, in areas where people are less likely to come back to restaurants and are more concerned about getting the virus.

### Why does this problem matter?

Restaurants need to know what investments are likely to help them survive. With consumer fears over human-to-human contact at an all-time high, tools that allow restaurants to conduct business while eliminating touchpoints have risen in popularity. This trend is likely to continue even once dining rooms reopen, so restaurants will be investing in systems that support contactless dinings, such as mobile payment and ordering.

Regardless of when restaurants decide to reopen, the takeout orders that allow them to hang on during the roughest weeks will continue to be essential to the slow rebuilding of their business during the next year.

### Potential Audience

- Tech companies should be one of the most interested audiences, in the sense that restaurants are going to need to invest in more low contact technologies to provide contactless dinings (mobile payment, ordering). That translates into apps and websites usable by all age groups, investment in network security, tools to make delivery and pick-up smoother, apps to improve the pick-up experience and also some kind of share apps where diners can place a single order and pick up multiple items at different brands.
- Community Supported Agriculture, Community Farmers Markets: Their partnerships with restaurants are crucial to keep their own operations.

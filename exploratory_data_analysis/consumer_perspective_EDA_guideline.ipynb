    "\n",
    "According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, until 75 percent of people are vaccinated, we should all continue to wear masks and maintain social distancing, even if we’ve been vaccinated. That means movie theaters, indoor dining, sporting events and travel would remain challenged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, unless three quarters of the nation is vaccinated, the engine of the economy will not jump start the way so many are hoping. The debates about health restrictions and economic stimulus plans would continue.\n",

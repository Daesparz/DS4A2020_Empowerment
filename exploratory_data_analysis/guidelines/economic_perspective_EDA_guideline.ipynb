    "This notebook is one of the two first EDA notebooks that we are going to submit next Thursday. This Jupyter notebook is going to include the three following sections, all of them related to the economic perspective of the study. Create your own notebook as `topic_EDA.ipynb` in the `exploratory data analysis` directory to answer the following questions and extract insights from the data (what is interesting and related to the analysis we are doing) Then, we'll compile the results sorted as is indicated below in detail.\n",

    "First, we explore the general picture of the impact of COVID-19 disruptions in the US Economy analyzing Goods and Services Industries (as two generic edges, 1st hierarchy) through GDP, Income, Consumer Expenditures in both areas (BEA datasets). Then, we deep a little more talking about Food in both edges (2nd hierarchy) and split into groceries, stores, supermarkets, restaurants (3rd hierarchy), followed by unemployment in 1st and 2nd hierarchies (St Louis Fed Unemployment data) and 4th hierarchy (Unemployment restaurants Dataset).\n",
